## Setting Up Git

### Installing Git
- **Windows**: Download the Git installer from [gitforwindows.org](https://gitforwindows.org) and run it.
- **macOS**: Use Homebrew to install Git: `brew install git`.
- **Linux**: Install Git using the package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install git` for Debian-based distributions.

### Configuring Git
After installing Git, configure it with your name and email:

```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

This configuration sets your identity for all Git operations on your machine.

## Git vs. GitHub

### Git
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files, enabling multiple developers to collaborate on a project simultaneously. It allows you to create branches, merge changes, and manage your code history.

### GitHub
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides tools for collaboration, such as pull requests, issue tracking, and project management. GitHub adds a social and collaborative aspect to Git by allowing developers to share repositories, contribute to open-source projects, and review code.

## Cloning a Repository
Cloning a repository creates a local copy of a remote repository on your machine. This is useful for working on projects hosted on platforms like GitHub.

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
```

Example:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

## Forking a Repository

### Forking
Forking is creating a personal copy of someone else's repository on your GitHub account. This allows you to make changes to the project without affecting the original repository. You can later propose your changes to the original repository via a pull request.

To fork a repository:
1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the page.
3. The forked repository will appear in your GitHub account.

### Cloning the Forked Repository
After forking, you need to clone your fork to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/forked-repository.git
```

## Difference Between Fork and Star

### Fork
A fork is a personal copy of a repository that you can modify without affecting the original project. It is primarily used for contributing to the original project.

### Star
Starring a repository is a way to bookmark or show appreciation for a project. It does not create a copy of the repository. Starring is often used to follow projects and receive notifications about updates.

## Creating a Pull Request (PR)
A pull request (PR) is a way to propose changes to a repository. You create a PR to merge your changes from your fork or branch into the original repository.

### Steps to Create a PR:
1. Make changes in your forked repository or a new branch.
2. Push your changes to GitHub.
3. Navigate to the original repository on GitHub.
4. Click on the "Pull requests" tab.
5. Click "New pull request."
6. Select the branches to compare (your branch and the original repository's branch).
7. Add a title and description for your PR.
8. Click "Create pull request."

## Creating Branches

### Creating a New Branch
Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.

```sh
git branch <branch-name>
```

Example:
```sh
git branch feature-new
```

### Switching Branches
To switch to a different branch:

```sh
git checkout <branch-name>
```

Example:
```sh
git checkout feature-new
```

### Creating and Switching to a New Branch
To create and switch to a new branch simultaneously:

```sh
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

Example:
```sh
git checkout -b feature-new
```

### Deleting a Branch
To delete a branch:

```sh
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

Example:
```sh
git branch -d feature-new
```

## Mainly Used Commands with Examples

### Adding Changes
Stages changes for the next commit.

```sh
git add <file>
git add .
```

Example:
```sh
git add index.html
git add .
```

### Committing Changes
Records changes to the repository.

```sh
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

Example:
```sh
git commit -m "Added new feature"
```

### Viewing Commit History
Displays the commit history.

```sh
git log
```

Example:
```sh
git log
```

### Viewing Changes
Shows changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.

```sh
git diff
```

Example:
```sh
git diff
```

### Pushing Changes
Uploads local changes to the remote repository.

```sh
git push
```

Example:
```sh
git push origin main
```

### Pulling Changes
Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository.

```sh
git pull
```

Example:
```sh
git pull origin main
```

### Merging Branches
Merges the specified branch into the current branch.

```sh
git merge <branch-name>
```

Example:
```sh
git merge feature-new
```

### Stashing Changes
Temporarily saves changes that are not ready to be committed.

```sh
git stash
```

Example:
```sh
git stash
```

### Applying Stash
Applies stashed changes.

```sh
git stash apply
```

Example:
```sh
git stash apply
```

### Cherry-picking Commits
Applies changes from a specific commit.

```sh
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

Example:
```sh
git cherry-pick abc1234
```
