# Difference Between Push and Merge in Git

## Push

### Definition
The `git push` command is used to upload your local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing sends the committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository, updating the remote branch with your local commits.

### When to Use Push
You use `git push` when you want to share your local commits with others or update the remote repository with your latest changes.

### Example
Assume you have committed changes to your local branch `main`. To push these changes to the remote repository:

```sh
git push origin main
```

### Process
1. Make changes to your files locally.
2. Stage your changes using `git add`.
3. Commit your changes using `git commit`.
4. Push your changes to the remote repository using `git push`.

### Key Points
- `git push` updates the remote repository with local commits.
- It requires the name of the remote repository and branch (e.g., `origin main`).
- You need to have write access to the remote repository.

## Merge

### Definition
The `git merge` command is used to combine the changes from one branch into another branch. Merging takes the contents of a source branch and integrates it into the target branch.

### When to Use Merge
You use `git merge` when you want to incorporate changes from one branch into another. This is commonly done to combine feature branches into the main development branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`).

### Example
Assume you have a feature branch `feature-new` and you want to merge its changes into the `main` branch:

1. Switch to the `main` branch:
    ```sh
    git checkout main
    ```
2. Merge the `feature-new` branch into `main`:
    ```sh
    git merge feature-new
    ```

### Process
1. Create and switch to a new branch (e.g., `feature-new`).
2. Make changes, stage, and commit them in the `feature-new` branch.
3. Switch back to the main branch (e.g., `main`).
4. Merge the `feature-new` branch into `main`.

### Key Points
- `git merge` integrates changes from one branch into another.
- It requires you to be on the target branch where you want to merge the changes.
- Conflicts may arise if changes overlap, which need to be resolved manually.

## Summary

| Feature            | `git push`                                | `git merge`                                    |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose            | Upload local commits to a remote repository | Combine changes from one branch into another   |
| Typical Usage      | Share local changes with others           | Integrate feature branches into the main branch |
| Command Example    | `git push origin main`                    | `git merge feature-new`                        |
| Workflow Context   | After committing changes locally          | During branch integration                      |
| Conflict Handling  | Generally does not cause conflicts        | Can cause conflicts that need manual resolution|
