# Linux  Interview Questions and Answers

This file provides detailed answers to some of the Linux interview questions.

## 1. What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system based on UNIX. It is used on servers, desktops, and various embedded systems. Linux manages hardware resources and provides services for running applications.

The Linux kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. It manages system resources, including memory, processes, hardware, and file systems. It acts as a bridge between applications and the hardware.

## 3. What is a shell in Linux?
A shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface for accessing the services of the kernel. Common shells in Linux include Bash, Zsh, and Fish.

## 4. What are the differences between UNIX and Linux?
- **Source Code**: UNIX is proprietary; Linux is open-source.
- **Cost**: UNIX can be expensive; Linux is generally free.
- **Usage**: UNIX is often used in enterprise and server environments; Linux is versatile and used on desktops, servers, and embedded systems.

## 5. Explain the file system hierarchy in Linux.
The Linux file system hierarchy follows a tree structure. Key directories include:
- `/`: Root directory
- `/bin`: Essential command binaries
- `/etc`: Configuration files
- `/home`: User home directories
